# Austin Animal Shelter Analysis


# Project Description Describes what your project is and why it is important

There are tens of thousands of animals in animal shelters around the country. In this project, we will be attempting to identify some of the factors that can predict if an animal will be adopted. Our hope is that by using this data, animal shelters will be able to better identify which animals to arrange for transfer, or focus adoption efforts on so that less animals might die in the shelter.


# Project Goal Clearly states what your project sets out to do and how the information gained can be applied to the real world

With this project we will attempt to identify some of the factors that help lead to an animal being adopted from an animal shelter. We will also build a machine learning model with the intent of identifying animals with a lower chance to being adopted in order to get them a little extra help in getting adopted.


# Initial Hypotheses Initial questions used to focus your project

- What is the total percentage of animals that are adopted?
- Did the amount of animals euthenized at the shelter increase durring covid-19 years?
- What is the likelyhood that wildlife will leave the shelter?
- Are certain days busier than others for the animal shelter?
- Does an animal having a name affect the chances of them being adopted?
- Does an animal's sex have an affect on the adoption chance?
