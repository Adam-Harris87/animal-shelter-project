# Title Animal Shelter Analysis


# Project Description Describes what your project is and why it is important

There are tens of thousands of animals in animal shelters around the country. In this project, we will be attempting to identify some of the factors that can predict if an animal will be adopted. Our hope is that by using this data, animal shelters will be able to better identify which animals to arrange for transfer, or focus adoption efforts on so that less animals might die in the shelter.
